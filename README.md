User Stories

(1) Navigation/Nav Bar
The Nav bar allows me to navigate to the Index and New pages

(2) Index Page
I can see a list of income and expenditures with the date, the transaction name and the amount on the Index page.

There is also an Account total visible that sums all the different expenditures and shows the user how much money they currently have.

(3) New Page
I can click on a "New" button that takes me to the New page, with a form that lets me create a new transaction.

Once a transaction is created, I am navigated back to the Index page

(4) Show Page
I can see a single expenditure with more details and appropriate navigation links

(5) Edit page
I can see a form that is pre-filled with an individual expenditure that allows me to update the expenditure. Once updated, I am taken back to the show page where I should be able to see the updated transaction, without needing to refresh the page.

The edit form is accessible either from the Show page or Index page via button/link.

(6) Delete functionality
The expenditure can be deleted.

The delete functionality is accessible either from the Show page or Index page via button/link.

(7) Account Total
The account total is visible either on the Index page (this is more straightforward) or in the Nav Bar (this is more challenging).

The account CSS changes depending on the amount. The account should show green (or similar color) if the amount is above $1000. There should be neutral/white color between $0 - $1000. And it should show a red (or similar color) if the bank account value falls below $0.

The changing color can be text, background, border, as long as it is in/near the account total and provides clarity with what it is showing.

(8) UX/UI
There is effort to make the app styled. Forms are styled and properly labeled. The navigation is clear and easy to use, a color theme has been chosen and applied. At least one font has been chosen and applied. The app is responsive (readable/usable) across multiple screen sizes/widths.

(9) Deployed online
I can visit the application via the internet

Netlify is configured correctly that I can send a link to the New page to someone and it works (does not give a 404)
